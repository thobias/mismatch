  <h1>Test trials</h1>
  <p>We will start with three test trials for you to get comfortable with the interface. Two images of faces will be presented at the top left and top right of the window half a second after you click the start button. After 2 seconds a red circle will appear atop each image, click in the circle on top of the face which you found more attractive. The cards will now flip to show their backsides.</p>
  <p>You will get a follow-up question regarding how sure you are of your choice. After this the chosen image will be shown again and you are asked to select the main reason for choosing this face. This completes one trial.</p>
